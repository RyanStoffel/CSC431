# CSC431-A - Info Security & Computer Forensics – Ryan Stoffel

To run my program, there are two options:
- Hash a plain text message
- Hash a text file.

To hash a plain text message, here are the steps:
- Run this command: `java Hashing.java`
- When prompted, type in the message you want to hash.
- The hashed message will be displayed.
- You can also simulate a modification to the message by responding 'y' to the prompt.

To hash a text file, here are the steps:
- Run this command: `java Hashing.java`
- When prompted, type in the path to the text file you want to hash. For example, 'Example_Input.txt.'
  - Make sure that your txt file is in the SAME directory as the `Hashing.java` file.
- The hashed message will be displayed.
- You can also simulate a modification to the message by responding 'y' to the prompt.
